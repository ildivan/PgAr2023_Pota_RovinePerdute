# Lost Ruins

> Among pristine forests where man has not dared for centuries venture, the **Lost Ruins** are hidden: the remains of an ancient and now disappeared civilization, object desired by all explorers who want to define themselves as such.\
> A group of archaeologists, divided into two exploration teams, has decided to venture into the jungle convinced that they have finally identiﬁed the geographical coordinates of the legendary city: crossing the old settlements of that ancient people and reconstructing the traces they have left, they are sure of being able to reach the desired goal.\
> The **Tonatiuh Team** will move along the paths of those valleys with a futuristic vehicle designed to tackle any elevation without difficulty.\
> On the other hand, the **Team Metztli** will exploit the potential of a vehicle capable of traveling at virtually no cost on flat trajectories.\
> Both teams are sure of the superiority of their vehicles, but which of the two will have made the winning choice?
